## üõ°Ô∏è Features

- **Single Prediction**: Enter feature values manually to check for spyware/spoofing.
- **Batch Processing**: Upload a CSV file to analyze multiple records at once.
- **Visualization**: View a scatter plot of normal traffic vs. spyware/spoofing attacks.
- **Sample CSV**: Download a sample CSV file for testing.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Single Prediction
- Input values for the 20 required features in the sidebar.
- Click **Check for Spyware/Spoofing** to get the prediction.

### 2. Batch Processing
- Upload a CSV file containing the required 20 features.
- The app will analyze the data and display predictions.
- Visualize the results using the scatter plot.
